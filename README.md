# GreenDotPortfolioDemo

This repo will exist temporarily without authentication at my own risk and on your honor. 
The projects demo'ed are:
# Breezy: 
An MS Team service that allows to create and destroy teams (MS Teams) and schedule broadcast level video calls (meetings) intended for a private movie screening only for invited AD authenticated users with discussion, lobby and public recording functionality. Used by Hollywood studios for private screenings and state and federal law enforcement agencies (by strange coincidence) for remote evidence review and secure recordable conferences. 
# Breezy test suite in type script
Since Breezy heavily relies on MS Graph, Team app registration as well as APIM registrations to function, the unit test is written to test only a cloud deployed service. Local test execution is possible but not practical.  Infrastructure code to deploy Breezy are not provided here as it is substantial and functions as a multi-tenant and GOV tenant solution.

# AdRevenue service purpose is to download certain files from various complex AdServer reporting providers and load that data into Azure SQL DB
